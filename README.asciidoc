= Demo project for Integration testing with Elasticsearch

This project shows how to run integration tests with elasticsearch.

== Step 4

This step assumes that you ran the previous branch https://github.com/dadoonet/elasticsearch-integration-tests/tree/03-using-test-containers[03-using-test-containers].

We now check if elasticsearch is already running. If not, we launch test containers. Otherwise we just use the instance
which is running.

So the following command does not launch anymore 2 docker instances.

```
mvn clean install
```

Cherry on the cake, we can still run locally an elasticsearch cluster with:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

And when we launch the tests from the IDE we are getting immediate feedback.

Still we can't use a secured instance yet (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/index.html[X-Pack security] or running on https://cloud.elastic.co[cloud.elastic.co]).

== Next step

Look at branch https://github.com/dadoonet/elasticsearch-integration-tests/tree/05-cloud[05-cloud].

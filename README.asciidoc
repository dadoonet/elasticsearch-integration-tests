= Demo project for Integration testing with Elasticsearch

This project shows how to run integration tests with elasticsearch.

== Step 1

If you clone the repository and run

```sh
mvn clean install
```

It will fail because elasticsearch is not running yet:

```
[INFO] <JUnit4> says olÃ¡! Master seed: 6B97AD13CF87090
Executing 1 suite with 1 JVM.

Started J0 PID(4079@MacBook-Pro-David.local).
  1> 16:00:20,366 INFO  [f.p.t.e.t.i.ElasticsearchIT] Starting a client on http://localhost:9200
  1> 16:00:20,931 INFO  [f.p.t.e.t.i.ElasticsearchIT] Closing elasticsearch client.
ERROR   0.00s | ElasticsearchIT (suite) <<<
   > Throwable #1: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused

Tests with failures [seed: 6B97AD13CF87090]:
  - fr.pilato.talk.elasticsearch.tests.integration.ElasticsearchIT (suite)
```

So the first step is to elasticsearch locally.
If you have Docker installed (which is expected for the next steps anyway),
you can run from the project root:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then you can run:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

Or run tests from your IDE.

Once done, stop your containers with:

```sh
docker-compose stop
```

== Next step

Look at branch https://github.com/dadoonet/elasticsearch-integration-tests/tree/02-start-docker-from-maven[02-start-docker-from-maven].

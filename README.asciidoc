= Demo project for Integration testing with Elasticsearch

This project shows how to run integration tests with elasticsearch.

== Step 3

This step assumes that you ran the previous branch https://github.com/dadoonet/elasticsearch-integration-tests/tree/02-start-docker-from-maven[02-start-docker-from-maven].

We add https://github.com/dadoonet/testcontainers-java-module-elasticsearch[testcontainers-java-module-elasticsearch] to
launch our tests from the IDE. This project helps to launch an Elasticsearch Docker image
from Java.

Try to run tests from your IDE now.

But when we run:

```
mvn clean install
```

It actually starts Docker twice now:

* Once with fabric8
* Once with test-containers (from Java code)

== Next step

Look at branch https://github.com/dadoonet/elasticsearch-integration-tests/tree/04-check-if-already-running[04-check-if-already-running].

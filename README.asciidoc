= Demo project for Integration testing with Elasticsearch

This project shows how to run integration tests with elasticsearch.

== Step 2

This step assumes that you ran the previous branch https://github.com/dadoonet/elasticsearch-integration-tests/tree/01-start-elasticsearch-manually[01-start-elasticsearch-manually].

We now starts Docker container from Maven so you can simply run:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

But if you run the tests from your IDE, tests will still fail.

== Next step

Look at branch https://github.com/dadoonet/elasticsearch-integration-tests/tree/03-using-test-containers[03-using-test-containers].
